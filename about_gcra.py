                    (on the maternal or paternal side) or clinical characteristics 
                    with features suggestive of hereditary cancer. 
                    These features vary by type of cancer and specific hereditary syndrome. 
                    Criteria have been published to help identify individuals 
                    who may benefit from genetic counseling. It is important 
                    that individuals who are candidates for genetic testing undergo 
                    genetic education and counseling before testing to facilitate 
                    informed decision-making and adaptation to the risk or condition. 
                    Genetic education and counseling allows individuals to consider 
                    the various medical uncertainties, diagnosis, or medical 
                    management options based on varied test results, and the risks, 
                    benefits, and limitations of genetic testing.''')
